Assignment:
"Your assignment is to make a chatbot using Javascript, Node.js, and the OpenAI API (or another chatbot framework), 
and other frameworks and languages as you see fit. At a minimum this bot must assume a personality OR area of knowledge
OR perspective and answer questions posed to it by the user."

Project Prose

  With the introduction of OpenAI and ChatGPT, the use of artificial intelligence increased drastically. From being able to 
assist customers to writing code, the wide variety of applications made it possible to develop never before seen programs 
and software. With this in mind, our small team of four believed it would be best to use this technology in addition to 
OpenAI’s API to reimagine one of Nickelodeon’s most iconic characters to date: Spongebob Squarepants. From reigniting the
creative spark for four passionate Georgia Tech students to allowing kids to converse with their favorite personality 
living in a pineapple under the sea, this Spongebob chatbot is ready to go fishing for jellyfish and practice karate 
with his best friend Sandy at any time. 

  Before starting the development of the chatbot, our team collectively decided OpenAI was the best framework to utilize due
to the large amounts of resources in addition to their API and server. Since we were using javascript to code the AI, we 
used Node.js to run the server locally and test our newly designed chatbot. Once the planning was finished, we quickly 
divided our team into two: frontend and backend. While Sydney and Anya made sure Spongebob was well dressed for any party,
Cho and Xavier needed to figure out a way to bring him to life. Although none of us were official prompt engineers, we 
researched thoroughly to ensure that when Spongebob spoke, he sounded like himself. This was done by changing the content
of the role within the javascript file given to us in addition to creating a method that fed in a prompt as soon as the 
webpage loaded. This initial message would not be seen from the user’s side and was also utilized so that Spongebob would 
greet the user first. After retrieving the API key from OpenAI, Spongebob was ready to come to life. Some challenges we 
faced was the constant leakage of our API key due to the fact that we were uploading our files to github, in addition to 
connecting the index.html file to the server. We also spent a large amount of time ensuring that the chatbot’s personality
would always respond in Spongebob’s persona. Although this was not perfected, we believe we got decently close. 
  
  Our biggest challenge was connecting the index.html file to the server, as there were bugs in our code. For instance, certain
functions not referring to the correct variable names from the script.js file or index.html. Additionally, utilizing github 
to ensure that everyone’s files were synced also proved to be difficult due to the constant commits being made and files being
pushed or pulled. Nonetheless, the project continued to move forward.

   Although it is not perfect, we accomplished our initial goals of developing a Spongebob persona using the OpenAI framework and 
 connecting it to a html file with creative visuals. We learned how to utilize the OpenAI framework, connect ChatGPT to our local 
 server, and some prompt engineering to make Spongebob more like Spongebob. We hope that in the future we can utilize our newly 
 learned skills to design and develop more software and programs to make more immersive experiences as well as further connect 
 the logical aspects of coding to the artistic concepts of design.
